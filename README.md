## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Vue - Official](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) 

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. 

1. Disable the built-in TypeScript Extension
    1) Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VSCode's command palette
    2) Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`
2. Reload the VSCode window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.

## Customize configuration
